Through our analysis, we center contribute to the security discourse a notion of /differential vulnerabilities/, an understanding of security that recognizes safety and risk as differentially applied based on relational markers (e.g. class, race, religion, gender, geography, experience).

      description: My PhD dissertation at the UC Berkeley School of Information. Through a few case studies, I argue that people (designers and users) /believe/ that machines can \"read\" or \"decode\" the contents of the mind. I argue that these beliefs matter, fundamentally shifting our notions of what the mind is.

      title: When BCIs have APIs: Design fictions of everyday brain-computer interface adoption
      url: https://escholarship.org/content/qt9hk3d4ng/qt9hk3d4ng.pdf
      description: (DIS \'18). We use design fiction to explore the social implications for adoption of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). We argue that existing speculations about BCIs are incomplete: they discuss fears about radical changes in types of control, at the expense of discussing more traditional types of power, particularly labor. We present a design fiction in which a BCI technology creates a new type of menial labor, using workers' unconscious reactions to assist algorithms in performing a sorting task. Through these fictions, we deepen and expand conversations around what kinds of futures BCIs could create.

      title: From Scanning Brains to Reading Minds: Talking to engineers about brain-computer interface.
      url: https://cosmopol.is/assets/chi2018.pdf
      description: (CHI \'18). We presented software engineers in the San Francisco Bay Area with a working brain-computer interface (BCI) to surface the narratives and anxieties around these devices among technical practitioners. Despite this group's heterogeneous beliefs about the exact nature of the mind, we find a shared belief that the contents of the mind will someday be "read' or "decoded' by machines. We highlight opportunities for researchers to involve themselves preemptively in this nascent space of intimate biosensing devices, suggesting our findings' relevance to long-term futures of privacy and cybersecurity.

      url: https://cosmopol.is/assets/phycs2018.pdf
      description: (PhyCS \'17). We demonstrate a passthoughts authentication system that collects data from the ear canal. We show that this system is resistant to impersonation attacks (i.e., you can't break into it even if you know the secret thought). This result provides reasonably strong evidence that passthoughts combines knowledge and inherence factors into a single step.

      url: https://cosmopol.is/assets/limits17.pdf
      description: (LIMITS \'17).  In February of 2017, Google announced the first SHA1 collision. Using over nine quintillion computations (over 6,500 years of compute time), a group of academic and industry researchers produced two different PDF files with identical SHA1 checksums. But why? This paper uses the SHA1 collision compute as a site for surfacing the space of ecological risks, and sociotechnical rewards, associated with the performance of large computes.

    title: Is the Future of Authenticity All In Our Heads? Moving passthoughts from the lab to the world
    url: https://cosmopol.is/assets/nspw2017.pdf
    description: (NSPW \'17). We outline the main challenges that passthoughts would need to overcome in order to move from the lab to the real world. Further, we propose passthoughts as a fruitful case study for thinking about what sorts of "selves" authentication systems must be tasked with recognizing. We raise novel possibilities for authentication broadly, such as \"organic passwords\" that change naturally over time, or systems that reject users who are not acting quite \"like themselves.\"

    title: One-step, three-factor authentication in a single earpiece
    url: https://cosmopol.is/assets/ubicomp2017.pdf
    description: (UBICOMP \'17). Multifactor authentication typically requires multiple steps on the part of the user resulting in a high cost to usability and limiting adoption. We present a system that provides all three factors of authentication (knowledge, possession, and inherence) in a single step\: an earpiece which implements brain-based authentication via custom-fit, in-ear electroencephalography (EEG).

    title: Classifying Mental Gestures with In-Ear EEG
    url: https://cosmopol.is/assets/BSN2016.pdf
    description: (BSN \'17). Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) have improved dramatically over the past five years, but their inconvenient form factor has challenged their wider adoption. We investigate how EEG signals collected from the ear (e.g., an earbud) could be used for “gestural” control of a brain-computer interface (BCI). We find that an SVC reaches acceptable BCI accuracy for nine of the subjects in our pool (n=12), and distinguishes at least one pair of gestures better than chance for all subjects.

    title: Trust Your Heart: Assessing cooperation and trust with biosignals in computer-mediated interactions
    url: https://cosmopol.is/assets/cscw2017.pdf
    description: (CSCW \'17). We study digitally-mediated heartrate sharing in a controlled experiment. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, we find that \"elevated\" (versus \"normal\") heartrate of an exchange partner is associated with negative mood attributions and reduced cooperation in a social dilemma game. To investigate how specific our findings are to heartrate (as opposed to some other \"elevated\" biosignal), we replicate our initial experiment with a fictitious biosignal, \"skin reflectivity\". We observe a decrease in cooperative behavior only with elevated heartrate. Our findings highlight the role prior beliefs can play in shaping interpretations of a biosignal, while suggesting that designers can, perhaps inadvertently, train users to associate signals with social meanings. We discuss implications for how wearable sensors can mediate social interactions.

    description: To what extent can a machine know the inner workings of a person's mind, even theoretically? This course explores this question through a mixture of hands-on machine learning and critical discussions on theory. Students practice ML techniques on a provided corpus of data to produce a working brain-computer interface. Simultaneously, students engage critically with recent research in ubiquitous sensing technologies, and the discourse around them, tracing ideas to their origins in cognitive science.

    description: We describe the results of a randomized vignette experiment in which subjects were asked to make assessments about an acquaintance based on an imagined scenario that included shared heartrate information, comparing results from adversarial and non-adversarial contexts of interaction.
